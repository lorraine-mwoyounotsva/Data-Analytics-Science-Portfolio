# Portfolio Projects
In this section, I showcase data analytics projects, providing a brief overview of the technology stack utilized to address various cases.

### Titanic Survival Prediction

**Code**: [Titanic Survival Prediction.ipynb](https://github.com/lorraine-mwoyounotsva/CODSOFT/blob/main/Titanic_Survival_Prediction.ipynb)

**Goal**: To determine whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not, based on passenger features.

**Description**: The dataset contains passenger details such as age, gender, ticket class, and more. The project involved data loading, cleaning (handling missing values), feature engineering (creating new features like 'Title' and 'FamilySize'), data preprocessing (normalizing numerical features, encoding categorical variables), exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model training. Several machine learning models were tested, and the best model was evaluated using accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix.

**Skills**: Data cleaning, feature engineering, data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), machine learning, model evaluation.

**Technology**: Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels.

**Results**: A HistGradientBoostingClassifier model with hyperparameter tuning achieved an accuracy of 100% on the test set. Visualizations highlighted key patterns in the data, such as survival rates by gender and ticket class, contributing to a deeper understanding of the factors affecting survival.

### Iris Flower Classification

**Code**: [Iris Flower Classification.ipynb](https://github.com/lorraine-mwoyounotsva/CODSOFT/blob/main/IRIS_FLOWER_CLASSIFICATION.ipynb)

**Goal**: Classify Iris flowers into their respective species based on sepal and petal measurements.

**Description**: The dataset contains Iris flower measurements, including sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The task involved data exploration, preprocessing, visualizations, and building a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model for classification. The model was trained and evaluated on a test set to predict the species of Iris flowers.

**Skills**: Data cleaning, data analysis, data exploration, data preprocessing, machine learning (classification), model evaluation, data visualization.

**Technology**: Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn.

**Results**: The KNN model achieved an accuracy of 100% with no misclassifications. Evaluation metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score were all perfect, indicating the model’s effectiveness in classifying the Iris species.

### Credit Card Fraud Detection

**Code**: [Credit Card Fraud Detection.ipynb](https://github.com/lorraine-mwoyounotsva/CODSOFT/blob/main/Credir_Card_Fraud_DETECTION.ipynb)

**Goal**: Build a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions.

**Description**: The dataset contained transaction records with 31 features, including anonymized transaction details. The key steps involved loading the dataset, checking for missing values, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and handling the class imbalance between fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions. Techniques such as oversampling the minority class and feature scaling were applied. A Random Forest classifier was trained on the data, and performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

**Skills**: Data preprocessing, handling class imbalance, feature scaling, machine learning model training, model evaluation, data visualization.

**Technology**: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Imbalanced-learn.

**Results**: The Random Forest model achieved an accuracy of 100%, precision of 0.99, recall of 0.78, and an F1 score of 0.87. The confusion matrix indicated a very low number of false positives, with a higher number of false negatives, highlighting a potential area for improvement in recall for fraudulent transactions.

### Nashville Housing Data Cleaning

- **Code**: [Data Cleaning Project Queries: Nashville Housing.sql](Data-Cleaning-Project-Queries-Nashville-Housing.sql)
- **Description**: Data cleaning and preprocessing for housing sales records in Nashville from 2013 to 2019.
- **Skills**: DML (Data Manipulation Language), DQL (Data Query Language), DDL (Data Definition Language).
- **Technology**: SQL Server.

### Covid 19 Data Exploration

- **Code**: [COVID Portfolio Project.sql](COVID-Portfolio-Project.sql)
- **Description**: The project examined Covid-19 cases, deaths, and vaccinations by country (2020-2021). Included data loading, cleaning, preprocessing, and EDA.
- **Skills**: Joins, CTE's, Temp Tables, Window Functions, Aggregate Functions, Creating Views, Converting Data Types.
- **Technology**: SQL Server.

### Legendary Pokémon Analysis

- **Code**: [Legendary Pokémon Analysis (Study Project)](Legendary-Pokémon-Analysis)
- **Goal**: Predict Pokémon status based on characteristics and rank their importance in determining legendary status.
- **Description**: Dataset included Pokémon attributes like attack, defense, type, and size. Project involved data loading, cleaning, and EDA focused on attribute analysis.
- **Skills**: Data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization.
- **Technology**: Tidyverse.
